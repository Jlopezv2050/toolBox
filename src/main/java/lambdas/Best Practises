1. Specified the types of parameters vs. letting the compiler infer them

2. Used a return statement with curly braces for one-statement lambda expressions vs.

3. Used lambda expressions that contains one statement vs. Lambda expressions that have
more than one statement

4. Using parenthesis when a lambda expression only has one argument vs. not using parenthesis
since they're optional when there's only one argument
