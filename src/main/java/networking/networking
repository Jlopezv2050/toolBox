Client
Server
Host

Could Client and server be at the same host? YES! (ex. MySQL and Workbench client)

Â¿How data arrived from physical connection is routed to the app target? PORTS

Handshaking -> connection between client/server
Packets -> format of sent data

JAVA NET PACKAGE
---------------------------
High or level api you have or not to concern about network concepts or you are more abstracted.

Socket -> end point 2 way-connection. Client server have its own. Multiple clients connects the same server
and port but with its own socket.

Client socket instance is Socket and server is ServerSocket.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
-----------------------------------------------------------
When use TCP some handshaking has to be between server/client. Connect client to server and accept. Reliable but affect performance
UDP could or not be a server and don't send any response to message sender. So you don't need reliable connection or two-way
connexion or speed is essential.
Uses datagram (self-contained message) and it's not guaranteed to arrive at its destination.
In time-sensitive communication like voIP, skype is used.


CONCLUSION
TCP is more reliable because create server/client end-to-end connection. However this handshaking affects the performance
and in case server UDP has to answer client has to get the info from the Packet because datagram (UDP packet) is self contained:
data + address + port number.
