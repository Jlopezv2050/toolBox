           ORDER         DUPLICATES
LIST         V               V
SET          X               X

Map you can't retrieve ex. 10th element
Map/set can't be element of itself
Set is a saved as a key in a dummy HashMap

Sets
-----------------------------------------
Sets UNION/INTERSECTION
S1 1,2,3        S2 3,4,5

addAll 1,2,3,4,5        retainAll 3      removeAll 1,2,4,5

Example. Set from list
String [] a = "The fox is on the news".split(" ")
set.addAll(Arrays.asList(a)

Maps
-------------------------------------
As a Key you can use an inmutable class
map.getOrDefault(Key,item) if ! key use default
Collections.unmodifiableMap(map) --> the objects inside this collections are not affect by the "unmodifiable")

If you want insertion order LINKED HASH MAP/SET
If you want sorted version TREE MAP/HASH
