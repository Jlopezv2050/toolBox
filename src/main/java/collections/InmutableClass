1. You have a private attribute, you return through a getter. Instead of return
directly, do a new instance (wont't be the same reference or return an string)
2. Make fields private and final. Prevent even getters or changes through the class.
3. In the constructor use new for the fields which has been passed "with the reference". With
this even the variable passed to fill the constructor will be changed, your instance wont be modified.
